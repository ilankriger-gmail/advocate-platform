# Public Leaderboards & Rankings

Display public leaderboards showing top fans by coins earned, challenges completed, and event attendance. Include weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings with badges and recognition tiers.

## Rationale
Addresses critical gap identified in competitors (Patreon, Discord, Stan Store have no leaderboards). Gamification is rated important by 73% of users. Creates competitive motivation that drives engagement and differentiates from platforms with rigid or no gamification (Skool, Discord).

## User Stories
- As a fan, I want to see my ranking compared to others so that I feel motivated to participate more
- As a creator, I want to highlight my top fans so that I can recognize their loyalty publicly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Leaderboards display top 10/25/50 fans with their avatars and scores
- [ ] Users can switch between weekly, monthly, and all-time views
- [ ] Rankings are updated in real-time after challenge completion or event check-in
- [ ] Fans can see their own rank even if not in top positions
- [ ] Badge icons show recognition tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)
