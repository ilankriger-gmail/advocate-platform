  "task_description": "# Public Leaderboards & Rankings\n\nDisplay public leaderboards showing top fans by coins earned, challenges completed, and event attendance. Include weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings with badges and recognition tiers.\n\n## Rationale\nAddresses critical gap identified in competitors (Patreon, Discord, Stan Store have no leaderboards). Gamification is rated important by 73% of users. Creates competitive motivation that drives engagement and differentiates from platforms with rigid or no gamification (Skool, Discord).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a fan, I want to see my ranking compared to others so that I feel motivated to participate more\n- As a creator, I want to highlight my top fans so that I can recognize their loyalty publicly\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Leaderboards display top 10/25/50 fans with their avatars and scores\n- [ ] Users can switch between weekly, monthly, and all-time views\n- [ ] Rankings are updated in real-time after challenge completion or event check-in\n- [ ] Fans can see their own rank even if not in top positions\n- [ ] Badge icons show recognition tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond)\n",
